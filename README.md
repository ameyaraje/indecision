# Indecision

This is a simple ReactJS app that will decide what to do when you're confused. 
Just enter a bunch of choices and let the app pick something for you!

This is a part of the ReactJS course by Andrew Mead.

You can view the app on https://ameyaraje-indecision.herokuapp.com/ (deployed on Heroku).
